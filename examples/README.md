# Examples

Create a directory for each example.
Create a README.md file in each directory to help consumers understand the example.

> **Note:** Examples must be deployable and idempotent. Ensure that no input variables are requried to run the example and that random values are used to ensure unique resource names. E.g. use `random_pet` to generate a unique name for a resource.
